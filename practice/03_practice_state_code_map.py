OPTIONAL AI GUIDANCE PROMPT
---------------------------
I am a student in an introductory Python class. I am learning many coding
principles for the very first time. I am going to paste in the instructions
to a practice problem that my professor gave me to try before class.
Please be my kind tutor and walk me through how to solve the problem step
by step.

Don't just give me the full solution all at once (unless I later ask for
it). Instead, help me work through it gradually, with clear explanations
and small, easy-to-understand examples. Please use everyday language and
explain things in a simple, friendly way.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
Read customers.csv. Use the dictionary provided in the code comment
to map the state_code column to full state names using the .map() function. You
can look this function up first. Store the result in
a new column called state_name, then print the updated DataFrame.

# Dictionary for mapping state codes to names
state_map = {
    'CA': 'California',
    'TX': 'Texas',
    'CO': 'Colorado',
    'NY': 'New York'
}
